# GraduationDesign
Thesis Title: Title Research on two dimensional obstacle avoidance algorithm of UAV based on AirSim simulation platform.
DesignForEight.py is the source code file of algorithm which analyzes indications from distance detectors.
DesignForPicture.py is the source code file of algorithm which analyzes depth images from camera.
Last of all, I just display some pictures that show the virtual scene I built for testing my algorithms.
